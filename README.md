[Planarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarity) is a graph geometry game, [originally implemented in Flash](http://planarity.net/) by John Tantalo, based on a concept by Mary Radcliffe.

There is an [elegant implementation](https://www.jasondavies.com/planarity/) in JavaScript by Jason Davies, as well as a GTK+ [desktop version](http://web.mit.edu/xiphmont/Public/gPlanarity.html) by Chris Montgomery of Xiph.org.

The goal for this version is to sharpen my C# and WinForms coding skills. A working [implementation in Python](https://github.com/parappayo/planarity-py) is used as a reference.
